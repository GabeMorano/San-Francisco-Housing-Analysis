# San Francisco Housing Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze San Francisco neighborhoods data to identify valuation trends between neighborhoods and identify rental investment opportunities.

## Methods

This project uses real estate data from the San Francisco area read into python as csvs and organized into data frames. Sales price per square foot and gross rent are compared to identify neighborhoods where rent prices are rising faster than home prices. This will uncover investment opportunities for real estate rental unit investors. The data is grouped by neighborhood so that price per square foot and gross rent are easily compared between neighborhoods.

Then, San Francisco coordinates are read in and added to the data frame so neighborhoods can be overlayed and compared using HvPlot on a street map of San Francisco. From here, the best investment opportunities are visible as the neighborhoods with the highest gross rent and comparitively lowest sale prices.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to leverage publicly available San Francisco housing data to help inform investment decisions between neighborhoods in the area.
